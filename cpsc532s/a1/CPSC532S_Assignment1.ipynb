    "This assignment is inspired and adopted from the Deep Learning Lab from Vicente Ordonez's course on Language and Vision at the University of Virginia. The link to the original lab is <a href=\"http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~vicente/vislang/notebooks/deep_learning_lab.html\">here</a>. The first two parts of this notebook are taken nearly verbatim from his lab. Section 1 is provided for you and implements a single-layer supervised neural network; no coding is required for Section 1. Section 2 and Section 3 are the ones where you need to code the solutions and provide answers to questions.\n",

First, let's review the skeleton of a single linear layer neural network. The inputs of the network are the variables $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$, or the input vector $\\mathbf{x}=[x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4]$, the outputs of the network are $\\widehat{y}_1,\\widehat{y}_2,\\widehat{y}_3$, or the output vector $\\widehat{\\mathbf{y}}=[$$\\widehat{y}$$_1,\\widehat{y}_2,\\widehat{y}_3]$:\n",

    "## 1.2. Loss functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "After computing the output predictions $\\widehat{\\mathbf{y}}$ it is necessary to compare these against the true values of $\\mathbf{y}$. Let's call these true, correct, or desired values $\\mathbf{y}$. Typically, a simple loss or cost function is used to measure the degree by which the prediction $\\widehat{\\mathbf{y}}$ is wrong with respect to $\\mathbf{y}$. A common loss function for regression is the sum of squared differences between the prediction and its true value. Assuming a prediction $\\widehat{\\mathbf{y}}^{(d)}$ for our training sample $\\mathbf{x}^{(d)}$ with true value $\\mathbf{y}^{(d)}$, then the loss can be computed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$loss(\\widehat{\\mathbf{y}}^{(d)}, \\mathbf{y}^{(d)}) = (\\widehat{y}^{(d)}_1 - y^{(d)}_1)^2 + (\\widehat{y}^{(d)}_2 - y^{(d)}_2)^2 + (\\widehat{y}^{(d)}_3 - y^{(d)}_3)^2 = \\sum_{j=1}^{j=3}(\\widehat{y}^{(d)}_j - y^{(d)}_j)^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to modify the parameters [$\\mathbf{W}, \\mathbf{b}$] in the Linear layer so that the value of $loss(\\widehat{\\mathbf{y}}^{(d)}, \\mathbf{y}^{(d)})$ becomes as small as possible for all training samples in a set $D=\\{(\\mathbf{x}^{(d)},\\mathbf{y}^{(d)})\\}$. This would in turn ensure that predictions $\\widehat{\\mathbf{y}}$ are as similar as possible to the true values $\\mathbf{y}$. To achieve this we need to minimize the following function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{L}(\\mathbf{W}, \\mathbf{b}) = \\sum_{d=1}^{d=|D|} loss(\\widehat{\\mathbf{y}}^{(d)}, \\mathbf{y}^{(d)})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The only two variables for our model in the function $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathbf{W}, \\mathbf{b})$ are $\\mathbf{W}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$, this is because the training dataset $D$ is fixed. Finding the values of $\\mathbf{W}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ that minimize the the loss, particularly for complex functions, is typically done using gradient based optimization, like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).
